Prediction of title paper Seq2Seq &amp; Attention Lay

seq2seq is a general-purpose encoder-decoder framework for Tensorflow that can be used for Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Conversational Modeling, Image Captioning, and more.

In this notebook, we made a prediction for the title of the paper based on the Abstract, We follow the following steps:

* **Read Data Set**
* **Drop Duplicates and NA values**
* **Text Cleaning**
* **Siplt Data**
* **Preparing the Tokenizer, sequences & padding**
* **Upload attention Layer**
* **Load libraries**
* **Build encoder-decoder model**
* **Train the model**
* **Visualize training results**
* **Inference**
* **Test Data and BLUE Score**
